- logical design, (as demonstrated by the ERD you designed for your database),
- physical design, (as demonstrated by the physical database you created based on the ERD),
- sample data, and
- sample queries

Logical Design: demonstrate level of understanding of logical design principles
and methods by submitting an ERD that is an accurate and up-to-date representation of the
final structure of your database. Once done with database, reverse engineer your database into an ERD. 
Include an image of your ERD in thewritten report, within the discussion of the logical design.

Physical Design: actual project database that resides on the MySQL server will be the
showcase of understanding of physical design concepts and methods. Include adding the sample data and
the views you want to include, take a backup of your database in MySQL
Workbench. Take the backup as a single, self-contained file, (not as a folder with multiple files,
one for each table.) Take the backup, restore it back on some other computer to
make sure that it works.
